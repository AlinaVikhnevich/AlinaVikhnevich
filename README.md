👋👋 Hi, I’m @AlinaVikhnevich

👀 About Me
I specialize in DevOps Automation, Software Engineering, and Cloud Administration. My passion lies in embracing emerging technologies and mastering Infrastructure as Code methodologies.

🌱 I’m expanding my DevOps expertise by diving into Kubernetes for container orchestration and exploring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles beyond my existing knowledge of Ansible and Terraform, with a keen interest in Pulumi for cloud resource management. I'm also learning about monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus and Grafana for robust system insights and delving into DevSecOps strategies to integrate security into the CI/CD pipeline efficiently.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to system administration, automation tools like Ansible and Terraform, and cloud-based solutions. I aim to contribute my extensive experience in server management and automation to projects focused on efficiency and innovation.

⚡ Fun fact: Before diving deep into the world of DevOps and cloud technologies, I was a nail artist, creatively combining colors and designs to bring joy and artistry to everyday life. This experience sharpened my attention to detail and patience, skills that I now apply when scripting and automating complex systems. It's a testament to how diverse experiences can contribute uniquely to one's technical prowess!
