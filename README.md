👋👋 Hi, I’m @AlinaVikhnevich

👀 I’m interested in DevOps automation, cloud administration, and Linux system engineering. My passion lies in embracing emerging technologies and mastering Infrastructure as Code methodologies.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my DevOps expertise by diving into Kubernetes for container orchestration, exploring the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) beyond my existing knowledge of Ansible and Terraform, with a keen interest in Pulumi for cloud resource management. Additionally, I'm learning about monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus and Grafana for robust system insights, as well as delving into the security practices essential for DevOps, such as implementing DevSecOps strategies to integrate security into the CI/CD pipeline efficiently.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to system administration, automation tools like Ansible and Terraform, and cloud-based solutions. I aim to contribute my extensive experience in Linux systems, server management, and automation to projects that aim for efficiency and innovation.

⚡ Fun fact: Before diving deep into the world of DevOps and cloud technologies, I was a nail artist, creatively combining colors and designs to bring joy and artistry to everyday life. This experience sharpened my attention to detail and patience, skills that I now apply when scripting and automating complex systems. It's a testament to how diverse experiences can contribute uniquely to one's technical prowess!
